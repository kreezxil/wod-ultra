**BEFORE CONTINUING**
If you added mods to the pack that were not in the pack when you received, remove those mods and then try to duplicate the issue. I do not support bug reports where the mod pack was modified. For instance FoamFix and Optifine both do things to Forge that should not be done and as a result can break a pack or otherwise hide an error that a mod might produce. Those must be removed and the issue duplicated before you both with the following data requests.

**Pack Version**
If you are not on the latest version of the pack I'll mark this as not the latest version and won't fix. Please update to the latest version of the pack and try to duplicate the error.
